## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is located in the `data` directory. It is structured with text data and corresponding sentiment labels.

## Installation

To set up the project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Use the `data_preprocessing.py` script to load and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Train the sentiment analysis model using the `model_training.py` script.
3. **Prediction**: Use the `predict.py` script to make predictions on new text data.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Utilize the `sentimental.ipynb` notebook for visualizations and initial analysis.
